## [March 2024] QOSF Chort 9 -  Task 4: Solving Maximum Independent Set Problem using QAOA and Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm

> For details on the implementation, see [task_4/README.md](task_4/README.md)

This project implements a solver for the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and the Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm. 

### QAOA Algorithm
The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. It works by encoding the problem into a cost Hamiltonian and applying alternating layers of cost and mixer Hamiltonians to a quantum state.

### Quantum Adiabatic Algorithm

The adiabatic quantum algorithm used in this implementation is based on the principles of quantum annealing. It involves evolving the quantum system from an easily solvable initial state to the desired final state by slowly changing the Hamiltonian of the system.
